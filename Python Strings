# Python Strings - Learning Objectives Checklist

## 1. Introduction to Strings
- [ ] Understand what a string is and its importance in programming.
- [ ] Learn how to create strings using single, double, and triple quotes.

## 2. String Manipulation

### Concatenation
- [ ] Perform basic concatenation using the `+` operator.
- [ ] Concatenate strings with spaces.
- [ ] Concatenate multiple strings together.

### Repetition
- [ ] Repeat strings using the `*` operator.
- [ ] Create patterns and dividers using repetition.
- [ ] Understand and handle empty strings, zero repetition, and negative values in repetition.
- [ ] Multiply strings with variables.

## 3. String Operators

### Comparison Operators
- [ ] Use `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, and `>=` to compare strings.
- [ ] Understand lexicographic order for string comparisons.

### Membership Operators
- [ ] Use `in` and `not in` to check for substrings in a string.
- [ ] Handle case sensitivity and special characters in substring searches.

## 4. String Escape Characters

### Tab (`\t`)
- [ ] Use tabs in strings for formatting.

### Newline (`\n`)
- [ ] Insert newlines into strings and understand multiline string formatting.

### Single Quote (`\'`)
- [ ] Escape single quotes inside strings.

### Backslash (`\\`)
- [ ] Escape backslashes and special characters.

## 5. String Formatting

### Using the `%` Operator
- [ ] Format strings using `%s`, `%d`, `%f`, `%c`, and other placeholders.

### Using `str.format()` Method
- [ ] Replace placeholders with positional and keyword arguments.
- [ ] Reuse positional and keyword arguments with index reordering and nested formatting.

### F-Strings (String Interpolation)
- [ ] Use expressions inside f-strings for dynamic string generation.
- [ ] Format numbers and other data types using f-strings.

## 6. Raw Strings (r-strings)
- [ ] Understand the purpose of raw strings to prevent escape sequences.
- [ ] Use raw strings for file paths and strings containing escape sequences.

## 7. String Indexing
- [ ] Understand string indexing, both positive and negative.
- [ ] Access individual characters of a string using indexing.

## 8. String Methods

### Commonly Used Methods
- [ ] `len()`: Get the length of a string.
- [ ] `upper()`, `lower()`: Convert strings to uppercase or lowercase.
- [ ] `strip()`: Remove leading and trailing whitespace.
- [ ] `replace()`: Replace parts of a string with another substring.
- [ ] `split()`: Split a string into a list based on a separator.
- [ ] `join()`: Join a list of strings into a single string.
- [ ] `find()`: Locate a substring within a string.
- [ ] `count()`: Count occurrences of a substring.
- [ ] `startswith()`, `endswith()`: Check if a string starts or ends with a given substring.
